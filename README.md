# Titanic-Survival-Classification

## Overview
In this study, we explore and analyse the data from titanic dataset. By this tragedy many people died, however, some people could still survive! This dataset, including 15 columns, provides us if a specific passenger died or survived during this shipwreck. Some columns don't deliver informative data. So, we focus on the valuable data. By classification, we may undestand if the survival of the passengers might have been dependent on their residency-classes in the titanic or nor.

Source of dataset: The Dataset of Titanic (as a csv. file) is available on the Kaggle.com. you may also find it under the projects profile.
